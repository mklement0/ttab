SYNOPSIS:
    $kTHIS_NAME [-w] [-s settings] [-t title] [-g|-G] [-d dir] [command [param1 ...]]

DESCRIPTION:
    Opens a new Terminal.app tab and optionally executes a command and assigns settings,
    among other options.

    Important: Terminal must be allowed assistive access in order for this utility
    to work, which requires one-time authorization with administrative privileges.
    If you get error messages instead of being prompted, authorize Terminal.app via
    System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility.

    The new tab will run a login shell (i.e., load the user's shell profile) and by default
    inherit the working directory from the parent shell.

    -w creates the new tab in a new window rather than in Terminal's front window.
    -s specifies the settings (profiles) to apply to the new tab, as defined in Terminal.app's
      Preferences > Profiles, such as 'Grass'; settings determine the appearance and behavior
      of the new tab; name matching is case-insensitive.
    -t specifies a custom title to assign to the new tab; otherwise, if a command is specified,
      its first token will become the new tab's title.
    -d explicitly specifies a working directory for the new tab; by default, the invoking shell's
      working directory is inherited (even if -w is also specified).
    -g (back*g*round) causes Terminal not to activate, but within Terminal, the new tab
      will become the active tab; useful in scripts that launch other applications and
      don't want Terminal to steal focus later.
    -G causes Terminal not to activate *and* the active element within Terminal not to change;
      i.e., the active window and tab stay the same. If Terminal happens to be active, the new 
      tab will effectively open in the background.

    NOTE: With -g or -G specified, for technical reasons, Terminal or the new tab will still
          activate *briefly, temporarily* in most scenarios.

    Quoted parameters are handled properly and there's no need to quote the command as a whole,
    provided it is a *single* command.

    To specify *multiple* commands, use 'eval' followed by a single, *double*-quoted string
    in which the commands are separated by ';' Do NOT use backslash-escaped double quotes inside
    this string; rather, use single-character backslash-escaping as needed.
    Use 'exit' as the last command to automatically close the tab when the command
    terminates; precede it with 'read -s -n 1' to wait for a keystroke first.

    Alternatively, pass a script name or path; prefix with 'exec' to automatically
    close the tab when the script terminates.

EXAMPLES:
    $kTHIS_NAME -t Green -s Grass  # create new tab with title 'Green' using settings 'Grass'
    $kTHIS_NAME ls -l "\$HOME/Library/Application Support"
    $kTHIS_NAME -d "$HOME/Library/Application Support" ls -1
    $kTHIS_NAME eval "ls \\\$HOME/Library/Application\ Support; echo Press a key to exit.; read -s -n 1; exit"
    $kTHIS_NAME /path/to/someScript # execute a script and keep the tab open on termination
    $kTHIS_NAME exec /path/to/someScript # execute a script and close the tab on termination.

  # Note: We use *menu-based GUI scripting* rather than *sending keystrokes via CMD_NEWTAB_1='tell application "System Events" to keystroke "t" using {command down}'
  #       !! We try to be locale-independent, so we don't use menu-item command *names*; this requires us to make the following ASSUMPTIONS, which we expect to hold in the future:
  #             - the new *window* commands are assumed to be in a *submenu* of the *1st command* ('New Window > ...') of the Shell menu.
  #             - the new *tab* commands are assumed to be in a *submenu* of the *2nd command* ('New Tab > ...') of the Shell menu.
  #       (a) compared to sending a keystroke, this is more robust and predictable; with sending a keystroke, the shell command to execute is *sometimes* sent to the *previous* tab, as the keystroke may not have been processed yet.
  #           In the default case, the GUI scripting finds the command by its keyboard shortcut so as to work locale-independently; it does, however, make the following assumptions (other than the pretty safe assumption that the command is in the 3rd menu from the left, the "Shell" menu in English):
  #       (b) it also allows us to create new tabs *with specific settings*, by finding the menu item by *name* (settings names are locale-*in*dependent, fortunately)
  #           Using this is preferable to trying to apply settings *after* tab creation with `set current settings of selected tab ...`, as the latter only applies *visual* attributes, not *behavioral* (such as what to do when the shell exits)

  # If no directory was specified, we explicitly use the *current* working directory,

  # Rationale: Terminal.app only knows the working directory of the *top-level* shell running in each tab (as it defines an aux. function,
  # update_terminal_cwd(), that is called via $PROMPT_COMMAND every time the prompt is displayed).
  # Thus, when this script is invoked inside another script, it is the *top-level* shell's working directory that is invariably used by
  # Terminal, even if the invoking script has changed the working directory. Since this is counter-intuitive, we compensate here
  # by explicitly setting the working directory to the invoking script's with a prepended 'cd' command.
  # $SHLVL tells us the nesting level of the current shell:
  # 1 == top-level shell; since this script itself runs in a subshell (2, if invoked directly from the top-level shell), we can safely assume 
  # that another *script* has invoked us, if $SHLVL >= 3.
  # Furthermore, we want to exhibit the same behavior when creating a tab in a *new* window, whereas Terminal defaults to the home directory
  # in that case - thus, regardless of $SHLVL, if -w is specified, we always use an explicit 'cd' command.
